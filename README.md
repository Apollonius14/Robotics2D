# Robotics2D
Python implementation of a 2D Drone simulator including options for user control. A simplified proportional-derivative controlled drone in 2D, linearised for small angle approximations

# Instructions

Make sure all files are in the same directory

To simulate the drone responding to a programmed trajectory
modify the trajectory in Trajectory.py then run either:

-Realtime_Robo_Animate.py for a realtime plotter (slow)

-Replay_Robo_Animate.py for a replay of the simulation (faster)

To watch the drone respond to simple keyboard inputs run:

-Interactive_Robo_Animate.py

Modify the drone parameters and controller gains in:

Parameters.py
